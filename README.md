# TM Party Games

Live at **https://tm-party-games.web.app** (the old `before-and-after-6a096.web.app` address redirects there).

Players join with a 4-letter code (or QR) on their phone. A session has several games that share the same players. Every session starts on a game selection screen, where the host picks a game (host phone or main screen). The host phone can then switch straight to another game from the (foldable) game section at the top; "← Games" goes back to the selection screen. Players' phones always show the active game (or wait while one is picked):

- **Before & After**: each player records a **video**; its first and last frames become their **before** and **after**. The host (not a player) drives the main screen from their phone at `/host` using the same code: before → after → (pause to discuss) → video.
- **Photos**: each player submits one **photo**. The host shows them one at a time (Previous / Next) or everyone at once.
- **[BLANK] in a Box**: the host picks an object (e.g. a carrot, making it "Carrot in a Box"), two players and which of them may look inside their box. That player can peek on their phone as often as they like; the other chooses once to **swap** boxes or **keep** theirs. The stage announces the choice and swaps the boxes, then the host opens them one at a time. Which box holds the object is stored outside the session (`boxSecrets/{code}`), readable only by the host, the main screen and the peeker.

  **Adding objects:** drop a picture into `src/assets/box-objects/` and deploy. The file name is the object's name (`rubber-duck.jpg` → "Rubber duck in a Box"). A photo replaces a drawing with the same name, so `carrot.jpg` takes over from the placeholder `carrot.svg`.

- **What's the Buzz?**: a light bulb on the main screen lights up (with a buzzer) for a second, seemingly at random; the players have to work out why. The secret: the main screen's webcam watches the room, and the light and buzzer go on **3 seconds after anyone stops smiling**. Face detection ([MediaPipe Face Landmarker](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker), model in `src/assets/smile/`) runs in the main screen's browser; the picture is never shown, saved or uploaded. The camera only runs while the light bulb is on the main screen, and Chrome asks once for permission. The host phone shows the secret, how many faces the camera sees and how many are smiling, and has **Pause camera**, **Buzz in 3 s** (for a smile the camera missed), **Buzz now** (a test) and **Reveal the answer**. Extra screens light up and buzz too.

In Before & After and Photos a submission locks until the host unlocks that player. Each game lives in `src/games/<id>/`; `src/games/index.ts` lists what a game provides to the shared screens.

- `/` — main screen (shared display). `/play` — players' phones. `/host` — host remote. `/screen` — an extra, view-only copy of the main screen (e.g. in another room): same lobby, reveals and videos with sound, but no music (the songs stay on the main screen's PC) and no controls. After a refresh it asks for one click so video sound is allowed.
- Firebase: Anonymous Auth, Realtime Database (session state), Storage (media).

## Setup
1. Firebase console: create a project; enable **Authentication → Anonymous**, **Realtime Database**, **Storage**; add a Web app.
2. `cp .env.example .env` and fill it in.
3. `firebase use --add` (select the project), then `firebase deploy --only database,storage` to publish the rules.
4. `npm install && npm run dev`. Phones need to reach the dev server: set `VITE_PUBLIC_URL` to an https tunnel/LAN URL.
5. `npm run deploy` to ship to Hosting.

## Downloading everything
The main screen's **Download all photos & videos** button (hidden until the host taps "Show download button on the main screen" on their phone) zips every submitted file in the browser (one folder per player). Because it fetches the files with JavaScript, the Storage bucket needs a one-time CORS setting. In [Google Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/?cloudshell=true) (project `before-and-after-6a096`):

```sh
echo '[{"origin":["https://tm-party-games.web.app","https://tm-party-games.firebaseapp.com","https://before-and-after-6a096.web.app","https://before-and-after-6a096.firebaseapp.com","http://localhost:5173"],"method":["GET"],"maxAgeSeconds":3600}]' > cors.json
gcloud storage buckets update gs://before-and-after-6a096.firebasestorage.app --cors-file=cors.json
```

(`cors.json` in this repo has the same content.) Players who were removed from the session are not included.

## Jukebox
Music is **never uploaded or committed**: the main-screen PC reads MP3s straight from a local folder. On the main screen (Chrome/Edge), click **🎵 Choose music folder** once and pick the folder (subfolders are included). The song list is shared with the host phone's **🎵 Jukebox** tab, which has Play/Pause, a Repeat toggle, volume, and tap-to-play. A song plays once (then stops) or repeats until you pause or pick another; it never advances by itself. Music pauses automatically while a video plays. Chrome remembers the folder but may ask for one click to re-grant access after a refresh ("Reconnect music folder"). Avoid picking `Downloads` or your whole home folder itself — Chrome refuses those; a dedicated folder like `C:\Music\BeforeAndAfter` works.
